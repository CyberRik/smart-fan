# Fan Sentiment and Share of Voice (SoV) Analysis

## Overview

This project is designed to track and analyze customer sentiment and Share of Voice (SoV) for various fan brands, specifically Atomberg, Havells, Crompton, and Orient Electric. The pipeline uses a combination of tools like SerpAPI, Google Custom Search Engine (CSE), Twitter API, and the Gemini Chat model for sentiment analysis. The ultimate goal is to compare the brands' SoV across different keywords and platforms, such as YouTube and Twitter, to understand public sentiment and engagement.

The workflow automates the following tasks:

- **Collecting customer reviews** from Flipkart for the brands: Atomberg, Havells, Crompton, and Orient Electric using SerpAPI.
- **Sentiment analysis** on these reviews using the Gemini Chat model.
- **Finding mentions on YouTube** for "smart fan" using Google CSE and calculating the number of mentions for Atomberg.
- **Sentiment analysis on Twitter** using the Twitter API for Atomberg smart fans.
- **Keyword-based analysis** for comparing the Share of Voice (SoV) of the brands using "bldc fans" and "energy efficient fans" as comparison keywords.
